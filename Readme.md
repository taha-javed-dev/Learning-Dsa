# DSA Learning Repository (Java)

I’m learning Data Structures and Algorithms step by step.  
This repo is my personal practice space where I add code as I learn new concepts — nothing fancy, nothing "course-like".  
Just clean practice, progress, and notes.

## Why This Repo Exists
- To track my daily/weekly progress
- To keep all my implementations organized
- To improve problem-solving with consistent coding
- To see how my code quality gets better over time

## What You'll Find Here
- Basic → advanced DSA implementations
- Problems I solved while learning
- My notes (when needed)
- Clean code + time complexity for most functions
- No perfect structure — I update as I learn

## Current Status (What I'm Learning Now)
- Recursion
- Basic recursion problems
- Time complexity understanding  
  *(I will update this list as I move forward)*

## Folder Structure (Growing Slowly)
- `/recursion/`
- `/backtracking/`
- `/strings/`  
  *(More folders will appear as I learn more topics)*

## How I Code
- No shortcut, no copying solutions blindly
- I try to write the logic myself before checking anything
- I keep code simple and readable
- I add complexity analysis wherever it's important
- I revisit old problems to rewrite better solutions

## Goals
- Build strong fundamentals
- Understand patterns (recursion, sliding window, etc.)
- Practice 300–500 quality DSA problems
- Be interview-ready in the long run
